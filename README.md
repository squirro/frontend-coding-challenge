## Squirro Frontend Coding Challenge

Welcome to the Squirro coding challenge! Your task is to create an APP that lists the best selling books for each book store. 

This repo contains a JSON:API based application which provides the data for the book stores. This API can be found in the `book-store-api` folder. Within the section below you will find more information on how to run/use `book-store-api`.

Your goal is to present the data (that you receive from the API) as shown in the wireframe:

#### Each circle marker represents specific task:
1. Circle with the Book store image.
2. List with a maximum of 2 books ordered by the number of copies sold. In case that there are no books, please display a "No data available" message.
3. Book store rating represented in stars. The interaction with the rating should update it's correspondent entry in the API.
4. Book store establishment date in DD/MM/YYYY format and website link. The API will return the date in ISO 8601 format.
5. Book store country flag image. The Book store API will only return a 2-letter ISO 3166-1 country code. Please use https://restcountries.eu/ API to get the flag image for each country code to display. 

**You should follow the wireframe positioning of elements, but you can make it a bit prettier ;)**

### Book Store API

JSON:API is a specification on how a client should perform requests that fetch or modify resources, and how a server should respond to those requests.
You can find the JSON:API documentation on this link https://jsonapi.org/format/ but we will explain you some of the basics here to make it easier for you. 

The Book store API contains the `stores`, `books`, `countries` and `authors` resources. Each of the resources can have a attributes object and a relationships object describing relationships between the resource and other resources.

**Breakdown of resources and their relationships:** 

- Stores
    - Attributes:
        - `name`
        - `website`
        - `rating`
        - `image`
        - `establishmentDate`
    - Relationships
        - `books`
        - `countries`
- Books
    - Attributes:
        - `name`
        - `copiesSold`
    - Relationships
        - `authors`
- Countries
    - Attributes:
        - `code`
- Authors
    - Attributes:
        - `fullName`
        
The API endpoint that you will need for most of the tasks is: `http://localhost:3000/stores`. This endpoint will return all store resources and related resources within `included` array.
If you need any other endpint, check the JSON:API specification. 

#### Running API:
- Clone this repo locally
- `cd` inside `book-store-api` folder and run `npm install`
- Serve it on the port 3000 by running `npm run start`


Rules
- You can choose between Backbone and React as your main framework.
- The project startup procedure must be documented.
- Javascript should be written in ES6 or above.
- GIT history must be clean.
- Application presentation must be done by responsive web design principles.
- Write CSS from scratch, please do not use Bootstrap and similar.

Happy coding and thank you for applying to Squirro!
